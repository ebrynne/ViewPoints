ViewPoints README

ViewPoints aims to provide a platform for geolocated evaluation of site performace and content for developers and other interested parties. Built upon the seattle network, it leverages this unique distributed system to provide consistent and valuable resources to any user.

Currently in an infantile stage, the application design remains largely undecided and therefor will likely change quickly and drastically for the initial development period.
